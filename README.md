#xss-demo
This is a demo of a simple cross site scripting vulnerable web-app.

In a form, the user can input data, which then gets rendered on the next page for the user.

For more info on cross site scripting I recommend [OWASP's XSS article](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS))
